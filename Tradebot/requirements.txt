Project Requirements:
1. A GUI to monitor stock prices of the Fortune 500 stocks. The GUI should read from a file of the top 20 most active Fortune 500 stocks and populate a dropdown with these symbols. The price should also update. The top option should start being monitored. There should be a button on the GUI to update the list at the user's discretion. When the user updates the list, the dropdown and the file need to be updated.
2. A graph of the current stock being traded.
3. A selectable list of the top 20 most active stocks for the last month with their current stock price.
4. Account balance.
5. A button to switch between paper trading and real trading.
6. The program must be able to get stock history and train a neural network on its history to predict outcomes.
7. It needs to be able to enter and exit trades on its own.
8. We need to build the program so we can later add the ability to monitor multiple stocks and enter multiple trades at the same time.
9. The broker for the project should be Alpaca.
10. The application should have error handling to manage API failures or unexpected responses.
11. The application should have logging capabilities to track its operations and any errors.
12. The application should be able to handle different market conditions (bull market, bear market, etc.).
13. The application should have a user-friendly interface.
14. The application should have a secure way to handle user credentials.
15. The code must follow PEP 8 coding standards.
16. The code must use the latest version of alpaca-py, which is 0.10.0.
17. When opening an inital trade the total cost of the trade should be around %5 of the account total. When opening a subsequent trade 
    if the previous trade was a gain, then the current trade should be %5 of the account total. If the previous trade was a loss then the 
    current trade needs to be double the lost amount. If there are three losses in a row then the trade amount should be %5 of the account total.
